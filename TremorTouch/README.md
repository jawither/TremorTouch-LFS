# TremorTouch

TremorTouch is a application that allows for users who experience tremors to make accurate and meaningful inputs on their touch screen devices. 

## Installation

Included in the repository is an apk file that when ran on an android device installs the application.

If you don't want to run this on your actual device, you may create an emulator within android studio by following the instructions at this link:

You can then transfer the apk file into the emulator by simply dragging and dropping the apk file over the screen of the emulator. Running the file will then install the application.

## Usage

Using TremorTouch is as simple as tapping your screen as you normally would. Once the minimum tap threshold is met, a red dot will appear on the screen representing where the tap will be executed.

When ready to make the tap, simply stop making taps and after a set amount of time the tap will execute.

To press and hold, continue making taps until the dot turns green. A hold will be executed at that location until there is no input for a set amount of time.
